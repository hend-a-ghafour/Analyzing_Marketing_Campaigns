### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***Daily conversion and mismatch occurrence via House Ads:*** 
Starting from January 11, 2018, there was a sharp and sustained rise in mismatch occurrences.This sudden increase appears to have had a strong negative impact on conversions, as the number of converted users dropped significantly after this date and remained consistently low despite continued ad activity.
### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***Estimating Conversion Rates Without the Language Bug:*** 
#### $\color{#454775} {Conclusion:}$
Had the language bug not occurred, conversion rates for non-English users would likely have followed a stable upward trend similar to English. The sharp decline and zeros observed in the actual data after January 10 clearly reflect the disruptive effect of the mismatch, underlining the importance of correct language targeting in maintaining user engagement and conversion effectiveness.

### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***A/B Testing - Email:*** 
#### $\color{#454775} {Conclusion:}$
The Personalization variant outperformed the Control group by ≈ 38%. This represents a substantial improvement and provides a strong statistical indication that implementing personalized emails can significantly increase conversion rates. The difference has been confirmed as statistically significant, reinforcing confidence in the effectiveness of the personalization strategy.

### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***A/B Testing - Email Across Displayed Languages:*** 
#### $\color{#454775} {Conclusion:}$
The test performed very well among English and Spanish speakers (increase by ≈ 39.00% & 166.67% respectively), while the results for the other languages were not statistically significant.
### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***A/B Testing - Email Across Age Groups:*** 
#### $\color{#454775} {Conclusion:}$
The A/B test results revealed statistically significant differences across all age groups. Personalized Ads performed strongly among users under 30, driving substantially higher conversion rates compared to the control(0-18 by ≈ 121.40%, 19-24 by ≈ 106.24% & 24-30 by ≈ 161.19%). However, for users aged 30 and above, the performance declined — with zero conversions observed among the 30–36 and 55+ groups, and a negative lift among the 36–45 and 45–55 groups. These findings suggest that younger audiences respond more positively to personalized email content, while older groups may require alternative engagement strategies.

***While the test was a success overall, personalization was not appreciated in certain regions and by certain age groups.***
