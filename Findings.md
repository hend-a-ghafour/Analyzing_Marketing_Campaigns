### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***A/B Testing - Email Across Displayed Languages:*** 
#### $\color{#454775} {Conclusion:}$

### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***A/B Testing - Email Across Age Groups:*** 
#### $\color{#454775} {Conclusion:}$
The A/B test results revealed statistically significant differences across all age groups. Personalized Ads performed strongly among users under 30, driving substantially higher conversion rates compared to the control(0-18 by ≈ 121.40%, 19-24 by ≈ 106.24% & 24-30 by ≈ 161.19%). However, for users aged 30 and above, the performance declined — with zero conversions observed among the 30–36 and 55+ groups, and a negative lift among the 36–45 and 45–55 groups. These findings suggest that younger audiences respond more positively to personalized email content, while older groups may require alternative engagement strategies.

***While the test was a success overall, personalization was not appreciated in certain regions and by certain age groups.***
