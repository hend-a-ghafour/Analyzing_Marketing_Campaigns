### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***Daily Engagement and Subscription Patterns by Age Groups:*** 
- The daily user patterns across all age groups were generally similar, with a preference for distributing more ads to users under 30.
- Daily user counts for all age groups peaked on 15-01-2018, likely influenced by the large email campaign distributed on that day.
- Conversion and retention peaks for all age groups occurred between 15 and 17 January.
- During the first half of the month, conversions and retentions showed weak consistency among age groups 0–18, 24–30, 30–36, and 55+, while the remaining groups exhibited moderate to weak consistency.
- In the second half of the month, a noticeable change was observed, as age groups 0–18 and 19–24 showed moderate consistency, while other age groups demonstrated weak to moderate consistency.
#### $\color{#454775} {Conclusion:}$
User engagement peaked mid-month, mainly driven by the email campaign. Younger users (below 30) showed stronger and more consistent responses to ads, especially after mid-January, while older groups displayed weaker consistency overall.
### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***Engagement and Subscription Patterns within Weekdays:*** 
##### $\color{#454775}{\bf Email:}$
- Reached its peak engagement on Monday.
- The pattern, except for Monday, is mostly identical — where daily users ≈ converted ≈ retained, showing high consistency.
- Another noticeable peak occurred on Tuesday, where conversions nearly matched Monday’s levels.
- The day of ad serving is strongly aligned with the amount of conversions, indicating a clear positive response pattern.
##### $\color{#454775}{\bf Facebook:}$
- A large number of ads distributed throughout the week resulted in relatively low conversions.
- Engagement peaked midweek (Wednesday, 314 users) and again at the week’s start (Monday), yet conversions peaked on Tuesday (43).
- The alignment between ad serving and conversions is weak to moderate, suggesting that timing alone doesn’t fully explain engagement outcomes.
##### $\color{#454775}{\bf House }$ $\color{#454775}{\bf Ads:}$
- The volume of ads launched during the week showed minimal impact on conversions.
- Two engagement peaks were recorded on Monday (Max = 799) and Tuesday, while conversions peaked on Wednesday.
- The match between ad serving and conversions is weak, implying that ad timing or targeting may not be optimized.
##### $\color{#454775}{\bf Instagram:}$
- A large volume of ads distributed through the week was met with moderate conversions.
- The highest peak occurred on Wednesday, aligning with the highest conversions, followed by Monday, which also had strong conversion performance.
- The day of ad serving is strongly aligned with conversions, indicating effective timing and channel performance.
##### $\color{#454775}{\bf Push}$ $\color{#454775}{\bf Notifications:}$
- Two engagement peaks were observed — on Wednesday (highest: 171 users) and Monday.
- Conversions peaked on Tuesday (19 subscribers), followed by Wednesday.
- The match between ad serving and conversions is weak to moderate, reflecting partial effectiveness in timing strategy.
#### $\color{#454775} {Conclusion:}$
Engagement and conversions peak mainly between Monday and Wednesday, with Email and Instagram showing the strongest alignment between ad timing and conversions. In contrast, Facebook, Push, and House Ads show weaker consistency, suggesting the need to optimize ad scheduling and targeting for better conversion outcomes.
### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***Daily conversion and mismatch occurrence via House Ads:*** 
Starting from January 11, 2018, there was a sharp and sustained rise in mismatch occurrences.This sudden increase appears to have had a strong negative impact on conversions, as the number of converted users dropped significantly after this date and remained consistently low despite continued ad activity.
### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***Estimating Conversion Rates Without the Language Bug:*** 
#### $\color{#454775} {Conclusion:}$
Had the language bug not occurred, conversion rates for non-English users would likely have followed a stable upward trend similar to English. The sharp decline and zeros observed in the actual data after January 10 clearly reflect the disruptive effect of the mismatch, underlining the importance of correct language targeting in maintaining user engagement and conversion effectiveness.

### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***A/B Testing - Email:*** 
#### $\color{#454775} {Conclusion:}$
The Personalization variant outperformed the Control group by ≈ 38%. This represents a substantial improvement and provides a strong statistical indication that implementing personalized emails can significantly increase conversion rates. The difference has been confirmed as statistically significant, reinforcing confidence in the effectiveness of the personalization strategy.

### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***A/B Testing - Email Across Displayed Languages:*** 
#### $\color{#454775} {Conclusion:}$
The test performed very well among English and Spanish speakers (increase by ≈ 39.00% & 166.67% respectively), while the results for the other languages were not statistically significant.
### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***A/B Testing - Email Across Age Groups:*** 
#### $\color{#454775} {Conclusion:}$
The A/B test results revealed statistically significant differences across all age groups. Personalized Ads performed strongly among users under 30, driving substantially higher conversion rates compared to the control(0-18 by ≈ 121.40%, 19-24 by ≈ 106.24% & 24-30 by ≈ 161.19%). However, for users aged 30 and above, the performance declined — with zero conversions observed among the 30–36 and 55+ groups, and a negative lift among the 36–45 and 45–55 groups. These findings suggest that younger audiences respond more positively to personalized email content, while older groups may require alternative engagement strategies.

***While the test was a success overall, personalization was not appreciated in certain regions and by certain age groups.***
