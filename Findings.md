### $\color{#454775}{-}$ ***Daily Engagement and Subscription Patterns by Marketing Channel:*** 
##### $\color{#454775} \bf{Overall:}$
- Users tend to engage more around the middle of the month across most marketing channels — except for House Ads, which show no clear temporal pattern.
##### $\color{#454775} \bf{Email:}$
- A significant surge in ads occurred on 15-01-2018, marking the maximum number of daily ads.
- This spike led to the highest subscription count (63), with 57 users retained — both representing the top figures across all channels.
- Subscriptions and retentions show a strong positive relationship with the number of daily users, suggesting that increased exposure directly boosted engagement and retention.
##### $\color{#454775} \bf{Facebook:}$
- The daily user pattern is inconsistent, with engagement levels fluctuating throughout the month and peaking near the end.
- Subscriptions (17) and retentions (10) reached their maximum on 16-01-2018.
- The overall trend shows a weak-to-moderate alignment between daily user activity, subscriptions, and retentions, implying that ad exposure alone did not strongly influence conversion outcomes.
##### $\color{#454775} \bf{House }$ $\color{#454775} \bf{Ads:}$
