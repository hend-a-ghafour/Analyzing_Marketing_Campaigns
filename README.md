   > - ***Control (variant = control)*** â†’ _The user was shown a generic version of the ad, without personalization. This group is used as a baseline to compare results and measure how effective personalization is._

## $\color{Red}{Initial}$ $\color{Red}{Investigation:}$
- The first half of the month sticks around 300 users/day. The peak was in the middle of the month "15/1/2018" 
  with number of users = 767 "on Monday".<br>
  ***This may be because we sent out a big marketing email, which reached many users who are not daily visitors of the site***

- Users were mostly engaged at the week start "on Monday"

- Nearly half of the users were reached through House Ads, making it the primary marketing channel. Social media (Instagram and Facebook combined) also plays a major role, accounting for over one-third of users, while Push and Email contribute relatively smaller shares.

- The dataset shows a nearly even distribution between control and personalization groups.<br>
  ***Which suggests that the experiment was designed to fairly compare the effectiveness of personalized ads versus standard ads.***

- The conversion rate is relatively low, with only about 11% of users subscribing after seeing an ad.<br>
  ***This suggests that while ads are reaching a wide audience, their effectiveness in driving subscriptions is limited.***

- The data indicates that English is used as the default display language, even when the userâ€™s preferred language is different.<br>
  ***This inconsistencyâ€”particularly for Arabic, German, and Spanishâ€”may negatively impact user engagement with the ads.***

- Users aged 19â€“24 represent the largest single segment (16.56%). More broadly, nearly half of all users are under 30.<br>
  ***Indicating that younger audiences are a primary group of interest for marketing efforts.***

- More than half of the subscriptions came from Instagram and Facebook, highlighting social media as the most effective subscribing channels. House Ads, Email, and Push play smaller roles.<br>
  ***This imbalance raises questions about whether ad distribution is aligned with channel effectiveness and audience targeting.***

- Despite its strong performance in attracting subscribers, House Ads ranked fourth in retention rate, with 55.93% of its subscribers retained.

- Across all channels, more than half of subscribed users were retained.\n
  ***Indicating a generally good retention performance overall.***

- Social media channels not only attract the most users but also maintain relatively high retention rates (~70%).
  ***Suggesting both strong acquisition and engagement potential.***
