   > - ***Control (variant = control)*** â†’ _The user was shown a generic version of the ad, without personalization. This group is used as a baseline to compare results and measure how effective personalization is._

## $\color{#454775}{Data}$ $\color{#454775}{Exploring:}$
### ***Initial Investigation:***
- The first half of the month sticks around 300 users/day. The peak was in the middle of the month "15/1/2018" 
  with number of users = 767 "on Monday".<br>
  ***This may be because we sent out a big marketing email, which reached many users who are not daily visitors of the site***

- Users were mostly engaged at the week start "on Monday"

- Nearly half of the users were reached through House Ads, making it the primary marketing channel. Social media (Instagram and Facebook combined) also plays a major role, accounting for over one-third of users, while Push and Email contribute relatively smaller shares.

- The dataset shows a nearly even distribution between control and personalization groups.<br>
  ***Which suggests that the experiment was designed to fairly compare the effectiveness of personalized ads versus standard ads.***

- The conversion rate is relatively low, with only about 11% of users subscribing after seeing an ad.<br>
  ***This suggests that while ads are reaching a wide audience, their effectiveness in driving subscriptions is limited.***

- The data indicates that English is used as the default display language, even when the userâ€™s preferred language is different.<br>
  ***This inconsistencyâ€”particularly for Arabic, German, and Spanishâ€”may negatively impact user engagement with the ads.***

- Users aged 19â€“24 represent the largest single segment (16.56%). More broadly, nearly half of all users are under 30.<br>
  ***Indicating that younger audiences are a primary group of interest for marketing efforts.***

- More than half of the subscriptions came from Instagram and Facebook, highlighting social media as the most effective subscribing channels. House Ads, Email, and Push play smaller roles.<br>
  ***This imbalance raises questions about whether ad distribution is aligned with channel effectiveness and audience targeting.***

- Despite its strong performance in attracting subscribers, House Ads ranked fourth in retention rate, with 55.93% of its subscribers retained.

- Across all channels, more than half of subscribed users were retained.\n
  ***Indicating a generally good retention performance overall.***

- Social media channels not only attract the most users but also maintain relatively high retention rates (~70%).
  ***Suggesting both strong acquisition and engagement potential.***
### $\color{#454775}{Q1:}$ ***Was the campaign successful?***
#### Key Findings:
- ***Conversion Rate*** = 13.92% , and ***Retention Rate*** = 66.8%.
- ***Marketing Channels:***
    - **House Ads**, exhibit a performance gap, with extensive ad distribution ***(â‰ˆ47%)***, not translating into results â€” both conversion (7.51%) and 
  retention (58.05%) rates remain the lowest.<br>
      ***This indicates that despite being the most widely used marketing channel, House Ads are the least effective in driving both subscriptions and long-term retention.***
    - **Email**,emonstrates the highest performance, achieving both the top conversion rate (29.11%) and retention rate (73.29%).
    - **Push notifications** rank second in retention (70.13%), despite their low distribution and conversion rates, suggesting strong post-conversion engagement.
- ***Variant Classifications:***
  - Despite being almost evenly distributed across marketing channels, **personalized ads** successfully encouraged more users to subscribe compared to **standard (control) ads**
      - **Personalized ads** achieved a higher *conversion rate* (16.80%) than both the control group (9.29%) and the overall conversion rate (13.92%).
      - **Personalized ads** not only converted more users but also achieved a higher retention rate (66.23%) compared to the control group (62.79%).<br>
      ***This indicates that users acquired through personalized ads are more likely to stay subscribed, reinforcing the effectiveness of personalization in both conversion and retention.***
- ***Language sataus:***
  - Users are more likely to subscribe when the ad language matches their preferred language:
    - Achieving a conversion rate of 14.16%, which is above the overall conversion rate (13.92%) compared to 6.70% for the Non-matching Languages.<br>
      ***This highlights the importance of language alignment and localization when distributing ads to maximize engagement and conversions.***
    - Retention rate for matched languages (64.98%) is significantly higher than that of non-matched languages (48.15%), mirroring the conversion rate trend.
    - The matched-language retention rate (64.98%) is also very close to the overall retention rate (64.53%).<br>
      ***reinforcing the importance of language consistency in maintaining user engagement.***
- ***Age Groups:***
   - Ages 19â€“24 show the highest conversion rate (23.24%) and retention rate (68.98%), making this the most responsive and loyal segment.
   - Ages 24â€“30 and 0â€“18 also perform well, with relatively strong conversion and retention rates above 15%.
  - Older age groups (30+) show significantly lower conversion rates (~7%) and slightly lower retention rates, except for 55+, which shows a better retention (67.11%) despite low conversion.
#### Insights:  
- A rising concerns about the efficiency of Ad distribution, suggesting that reallocating ad resources toward higher-performing channels (like Email or Instagram) could improve overall results.
- Increase investment in Email campaigns, as this channel delivers the highest conversion and retention performance.
- Leverage Push notifications more strategically â€” their strong retention suggests they effectively keep users engaged post-subscription.
- personalization positively influences user engagement and conversion, reinforcing the value of tailoring ad content to user preferences.
- Personalized ads outperform control ads in both conversion and retention, showing stronger user engagement overall.
- Understanding the ad plays a major role in driving user engagement â€” ads that are clearly understood (e.g., those matching the userâ€™s preferred language) show significantly higher conversion and retention rates _(14.16% & 64.89% respectively)_.
- Younger audiences (under 30) are more likely to engage and remain retained after conversion, while engagement among users above 30 is weaker.
Ages above 55, While less likely to convert, exhibit better loyalty once they do.
